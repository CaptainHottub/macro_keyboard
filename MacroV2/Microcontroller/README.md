The Current PCB is using a Raspberry Pi Pico (Overkill I know)


Next PCB I order will have to be used to test led configurations, and have it use the KB2040 microcontroller.
Then once I got the LED wireing figured out, deesing a new macro PCB, where the rotary encoders are seperated by a key width, I want to pass my fingers through them.
Don't put a diode on the mode button, and remode the extra breakout pins.
