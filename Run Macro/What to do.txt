Try and make it in C because C is much faster then python.

Make a V2 of the MacroKeyboard Script with threading and messages

change the spotify play pause to the following
1 press is play pause, 2 press is next, 3 press is previous
It might slow down when running cpu intensive apps


Implement the following
class ThreadWithReturnValue(Thread):
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6893968/how-to-get-the-return-value-from-a-thread-in-python

Have every thing that needs to be threaed pas through above.

also use:
from ctypes import windll
user32 = windll.user32

Below gets the name of the currently focused app.
hWnd = user32.GetForegroundWindow()
name = win32gui.GetWindowText(hWnd)


Have a thread running in the background that checks what the focused app is every 1.5 seconds
then report it to the main thread

where the main thread will have profiles for and modes for what ever app
Ex: have a profile for Chrome
have a profile for starcitizen and different modes, ex one for flight 
have a button to open/close doors, focus shields














Have a .py file that holds all Virtual-key codes, and any hotkeys
