I just ordered a  new revision of the PCB so, the LEDS and mode button should work
I hav also been steadily improving th  driver code.
 
01/04/24:
On a recent commit I seem to have replaced the old macro driver, and I don't know how to fix it, so I will be using the newest version as my daily driver.

09/01/24: I assembled the Macro and found out I wired up the mode button and LEDs wrong. 
I will fix it soon and will order more PCBs, in the meantime I will make a new driver that will work with multiple keypresses and rotary encoders.

01/01/24: I Received PCBs on December 28 and will be assembling them soon.
