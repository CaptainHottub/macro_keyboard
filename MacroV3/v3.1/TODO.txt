Add a requirements file 

MAYBE
try and transition all pyautogui keyboard funtions to custom_keyboard
add a write function to custom_keyboard


Macro improvements

Look in code for global variables there. If there are maybe use the class. Idk. 
Spotify thing. Make it a class called controller. 
Or not maybe. 

Move Mode variable to driver script.
Remove it from arduino code.

Add RGB features
We will need to add RGB LEDs to PCB before RGB features

If I had a RGB features I don’t wanna have to flash the Arduino firmware every time I change the RGB colours or stuff

Currently The Arduino sends the button that was pressed to the driver. 
I want to be able to send RGB information to the Arduino
So like when The driver connected to the Arduino it sends like a string of text that has come what colours are on what 
button and maybe I’m like if it’s rainbow effect or if I press the button it’ll glow on the outside(kinda have my keyboard is set up now)


Change code on The Arduino so that it only handles what button was pressed and RGB
